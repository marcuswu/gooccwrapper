A (partial) go wrapper for Open Cascade

I am using this repository as part of another project of mine. I don't intend to write wrappers for the entire Open Cascade API. The project is open to pull requests for functionality others need.

## Getting Started
This project relies on my [C wrapper for OpenCascade](https://github.com/marcuswu/occwrapper/) and its [Readme](https://github.com/marcuswu/occwrapper/blob/main/README.md) for installation.
